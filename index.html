            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Ogunwemimo Oluwaseun. I am an undergraduate student at Covenant University studying Management Information Systems (MIS). I am also an aspiring front-end developer and product manager. 
                I am passionate about programming and hope to further my knowledge in the field. Over the years, I have acquired little of what it takes to be a front-end programmer, and I hope to develop my skills further. 
                Currently, I am in search of an IT placement in which I could be of use to the organization and vice versa in the aspect of furthering my knowledge and achieving my goals. </p>
